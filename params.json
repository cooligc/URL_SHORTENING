{"name":"Url shortening","tagline":"URL Shortening App","body":"### Welcome Url Shortening Application.\r\nThis is an app where we can short our url by passing some parameter to the Server. And we'll get a new URL which will be having some hash key. If we'll hit the new URL in the browser, Our REST Service will call and redirect the URL to the original URL.\r\n\r\nWe have different branches present for this app . You can use the following commands to check it out.\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Prerequisite to run this app\r\n<ul>\r\n   <li> Java 7 or above</li>\r\n   <li> Maven 3 or above</li>\r\n   <li> MongoDB 2.6 or above</li>\r\n   <li> Any REST Client either command line REST Client like cURL or visual REST Client like POSTMan or Advanced REST Client</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Technology used\r\n<ul>\r\n   <li>\r\n</ul>\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
